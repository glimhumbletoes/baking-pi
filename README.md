Baking-Pi 

"Baking Pi" is a free online walk through offered by Cambridge University tailored towards give the reader a rudementary understanding of the principals behind creating an opearting system for the Raspberry Pi (http://raspberrypi.org). This repository contains my interpretation of this tutorial. 

All the code is based off the tools and directory structures provided by the University on the site downloads page. You'll probably need these to make any of this code.

This is a learning exercise on my behalf, whilst I have some experience with x86 ASM, I've previously had none with ARM. That said if you want to ask any questions, please feel free to message me and I'll do my best to stumble through an answer.
