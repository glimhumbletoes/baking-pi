-- Theren no lincense for any of my changes, but the template used on the course does come with a licence. This licence is included in each subdirectory and should be respected  --

This is a mostly learning exercise on my behalf, whilst I have some experience with x86 ASM, I've previously had none with ARM. That said if you want to ask any questions, please feel free to message me and I'll do my best to stumble through an answer.

Feel free to do anything you like with the code I've created in this repository; if its of any use to anyone other than myself I consider this a bonus!
